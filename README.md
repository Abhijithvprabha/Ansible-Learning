# Ansible-Learning
Ansible Learning  Welcome to the Ansible Learning repository! This repository is designed to help you get started with Ansible, a powerful IT automation tool. Here, you will find various playbooks, roles, and examples to guide you through the basics and advanced features of Ansible.

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a simple, easy-to-understand language (YAML) to describe automation jobs, making it accessible to a wide range of IT professionals.

Ansible is push-based by default. Making a change looks like
this:
1. You: make a change to a playbook.
2. You: run the new playbook.
3. Ansible: connects to servers and executes modules that change the
state of the servers.
As soon as you run the ansible-playbook command, Ansible
connects to the remote servers and does its thing; this lowers the risk of
random servers potentially breaking whenever their scheduled tasks fail to
change things successfully.
