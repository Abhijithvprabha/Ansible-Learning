The ansible-galaxy install command can be used to:

    Install a role
    Install a collection

In this example, the ansible.posix collection is installed. Notice that by default, the collection is installed to the users collections directory (/home/john.doe/.ansible/collections).

$ ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Installing 'ansible.posix:1.2.0' to '/home/john.doe/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ansible/posix'
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/ansible-posix-1.2.0.tar.gz to /home/john.doe/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-15258q2alfwvq/tmpdesamf4k
ansible.posix (1.2.0) was installed successfully


The -p or --collections-path option can be used to specify the installation directory. In this example, the ansible.posix collection will be installed to /usr/local/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ansible/posix.

ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix --collections-path /usr/local/ansible/collections

 

In this scenario, it probably makes the most sense to append /usr/local/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ansible/posix to the library directive ansible.cfg.

library = /usr/local/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ansible/posix
